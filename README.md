# LLM Lab

This project documents my experiments for training Large Language Models (LLMs) with various architectures, using MLFlow for logging and tracking.

## Goals

- Experiment with different LLM architectures
- MLFlow integration for experiment tracking

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd llm-lab
   ```

2. Install dependencies using uv:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

## Usage

- Start MLFlow server with `mlflow server --port 5000`
- My experiment notebook: `experiments.ipynb`
- View MLFlow metrics in the MLFlow UI
